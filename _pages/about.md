I am a postdoctoral researcher in [XuLab](https://xulabs.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, working with [Prof. Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). My research interests span the areas of machine learning (ML) and computer vision. 
I obtained my M.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Tehran, Iran.
